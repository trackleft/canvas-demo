Experience Builder (or XB for short) is Drupal's next-generation page building tool, [currently under heavy development on drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/project/experience_builder). This is a demo package of Drupal to try out Experience Builder with a demo design system and sample pages. 😎

This repository is intended to provide a **throwaway demo** of Experience Builder. **Experience Builder is not yet stable** and could change anything, at any time, without warning. 

There is no update path yet; data loss is possible. Additionally, this demo project will be _abandoned_ when Drupal CMS includes sufficient functionality to supersede the demo. That is expected around DrupalCon Vienna in October 2025. 

**You ABSOLUTELY _SHOULD NOT_ use this project to build a real site.**

## This Is How the Demo Looks Like

## Getting Started with the Demo 🚀

We strongly recommend using [DDEV](https://ddev.com/get-started/) (version 1.24.0 or later) to run this project, since it includes everything you'll need.

Cloning the repository locally is not required!

Instead, in a terminal with DDEV installed, run the following commands to spin it up:
```shell
mkdir xb-demo
cd xb-demo
ddev config --project-type=drupal11 --docroot=web
ddev composer create-project phenaproxima/xb-demo --stability=dev
ddev launch
```
You don't _have_ to use DDEV; any tech stack that supports Drupal should work just fine.

## Issues and Help

- Issues found in the demo should be submitted at https://github.com/phenaproxima/xb-demo/issues
